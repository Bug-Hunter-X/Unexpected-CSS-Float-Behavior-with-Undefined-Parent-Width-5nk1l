The following CSS code results in unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This code snippet intends to make the `div` elements take up 50% of the available width and float them left. However, if the parent element does not have a defined width, the floats might not behave as expected, and the layout may become unpredictable.

The issue arises because floating elements only consider the width of their parent container if the parent container's width is explicitly set.  Without a defined width on the parent, the floats might collapse, leading to unexpected positioning and rendering.
